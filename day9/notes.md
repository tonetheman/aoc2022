## wtf is a 2d array in nim
this is the second day I have used them and still really do not understand how they are defined
part of it is the shitty manual does nothing to explain what newSeq really does
it appears to not really allocate the array?

## hash maps take too much mental work to use
in other languages they are defined better in nim it is something else or just not there in the base language
weird but annoying and i have to look it up every time
