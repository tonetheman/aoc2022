# advent of code 2022

Nothing too hard. More or less report break logic.

Only thing interesting to me is the slice `^` operators. Much like python has. I can never remember that nim even has those but here is the link to the manual.

Nothing crazy for today either. Always hard to think ahead for part2 given you do not know how the problem will turn.

So I went overboard and made enums and made big if statements. I think I could have come up with a coding scheme that would have made things easier to add up maybe. But it would have obscured things. So I left it simple stupid.
